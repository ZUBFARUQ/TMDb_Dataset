# Udacity--Project-Investigate-TMDB-Movies-Dataset
## By UMAR FARUQ ZUBAIRU

## Project Overview
> In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.
Furthermore, > In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

## Introduction
> For this project, I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents my findings. I will start by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I will use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.

### What I have learn?
After completing the project, I have learned following :

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
